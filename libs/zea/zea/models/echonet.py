Echonet-Dynamic segmentation model for cardiac ultrasound segmentation.

To try this model, simply load one of the available presets:

.. doctest::

    >>> from zea.models.echonet import EchoNetDynamic

    >>> model = EchoNetDynamic.from_preset("echonet-dynamic")  # doctest: +SKIP

.. important::
    This is a ``zea`` implementation of the model.
    For the original paper and code, see `here <https://echonet.github.io/dynamic/>`_.

    *Nature 580.7802 (2020): 252-256*

.. seealso::
    A tutorial notebook where this model is used:
    :doc:`../notebooks/models/left_ventricle_segmentation_example`.

.. note::
    This model is only currently supported with the TensorFlow or JAX :ref:`backend-installation`.
    When using TensorFlow as backend, the model will work out of the box. When using JAX as backend,
    the model is built using TensorFlow and then converted to JAX. This requires both
    TensorFlow and JAX to be installed, which can be tricky regarding compatible CUDA versions.
    One option is to run in our :ref:`docker-information` container, which has been tested
    to work with both backends.
